    <h1>ChessCoach Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective date: February 28, 2026</p>

    <p>ChessCoach ("the App") is developed by Mark Lifson. This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data stored on your device only</h3>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device using standard iOS storage. This data is <strong>never uploaded to our servers</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your learning progress, opening mastery, and session history</li>
        <li>Spaced repetition review schedule</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings (ELO rating, sound preferences, daily goals)</li>
        <li>Streak and speed run records</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data sent to third-party services (optional, Pro only)</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use AI coaching features with an external provider, the App may send chess position data (board state in FEN notation, move history, and your ELO setting) to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude API)</strong> &mdash; if you configure a Claude API key in Settings. Subject to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Your own Ollama server</strong> &mdash; if you configure a local Ollama endpoint. Data stays on your network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can avoid sending any data externally by using the on-device AI model, which processes everything locally on your iPhone.</p>

    <h3>Data sent to us</h3>
    <p>If you voluntarily submit feedback through the in-app feedback button, the following is sent to our feedback service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your feedback message and category</li>
        <li>The screen you submitted from</li>
        <li>App version, iOS version, and device model (for debugging)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect your name, email, or any account information. Feedback is anonymous.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No contacts, photos, or files</li>
        <li>No advertising identifiers or tracking</li>
        <li>No analytics or crash reporting SDKs</li>
        <li>No cookies or web tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers a one-time, non-consumable purchase ("ChessCoach Pro") processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The App does not require an account and does not collect personal information.</p>

    <h2>5. API Key Storage</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the Claude AI provider, you enter your own Anthropic API key. This key is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stored securely on your device using the <strong>iOS Keychain</strong> (Apple's encrypted credential storage)</li>
        <li>Sent only to Anthropic's servers (<code>api.anthropic.com</code>) over HTTPS when you request AI coaching</li>
        <li><strong>Never</strong> sent to our servers or any other third party</li>
        <li>Deleted when you uninstall the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data stored on your device uses standard iOS storage mechanisms and is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, encryption at rest). API keys are stored in the iOS Keychain with hardware-backed encryption. All external API calls use HTTPS encryption in transit.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete all data:</strong> Uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid external services:</strong> Use the on-device AI model instead of Claude or Ollama.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback is optional:</strong> You are never required to submit feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by the effective date at the top of this page.</p>
