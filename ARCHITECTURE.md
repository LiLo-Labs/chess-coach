## Key Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Conformers |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `TextGenerating` | LLM text generation | `OnDeviceLLMService`, `ClaudeProvider`, `OllamaProvider` |
| `PositionEvaluating` | Chess position eval | `StockfishService` |
| `MovePredicting` | Human-like moves | `MaiaService` |
| `FeatureAccessProviding` | Subscription gating | `SubscriptionService`, `StaticFeatureAccess`, `UnlockedAccess` |
| `ChessboardColorScheme` | Board colors | `ChessComColorScheme`, 8 built-in schemes |

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | AI | Openings | Status |
|------|-----|----------|--------|
| Free | None | Limited | Enum defined, gating partial |
| On-Device AI | Qwen3-4B | All | Enum defined |
| Cloud AI | Claude/Ollama | All | Enum defined |
| Pro | All providers | All | Enum defined |
| Per-Path | None | Individual | Enum defined |

Debug: `DebugStateView` has presets for each tier. `AppSettings.debugTierOverride` overrides.

## Learning Phases (per opening path)

1. **Learning Main Line** → guided walkthrough with coaching
2. **Practicing Recall** → play from memory, hints available
3. **Handling Variations** → opponent deviates, student responds
4. **Review** → spaced repetition of learned lines

## Largest Files (refactoring candidates)

| File | Lines | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| SessionViewModel.swift | ~2000 | Main session logic, could split |
| SessionView.swift | ~800 | Large but mostly layout |
| OpeningDetailView.swift | ~700 | Opening detail + layers |
| DebugStateView.swift | ~600 | Debug presets |
| PromptCatalog.swift | ~400 | All LLM prompts |

## Board Theme System

11 themes available: 8 free (Chess.com default, Classic, Dark, Blue, Green, Purple, Orange, Red) + 3 pro (Walnut, Marble, Tournament).
Pro themes gated by `isPro` flag, shown with lock icon in Settings for free users.
Selected via `AppSettings.boardTheme`. Applied to `GameBoardView` via environment.
Piece styles: 5 styles using free Lichess assets (GPLv2+). Free: Classic (USCF), Lichess (cburnett). Pro: Merida, Staunty, California. Selected via `AppSettings.pieceStyle`, applied to `ChessboardModel.pieceStyleFolder`.

## Onboarding Flow

1. Welcome — animated crown, minimal tagline
2. What Are Openings — 3 animated bullet points (plan, why, obvious)
3. How It Works — 4-step animated number circles
4. Your Privacy — 4 animated privacy rows (no selling, no tracking, on-device, yours)
5. Skill Level — large ELO picker with +/- buttons
7. **Free Opening Picker** (free tier only) — choose ONE opening to fully unlock

`OnboardingView.onComplete` callback → ContentView decides whether to show picker or go straight to HomeView.

## Concept Intro System

`ConceptIntroView` + `.conceptIntro()` modifier shows one-time full-screen cards.
Tracked via UserDefaults keys per `ConceptIntro` enum case.
Applied on: OpeningDetailView (.whatAreOpenings), PracticeOpeningView (.whatIsPractice), QuickReviewView (.whatIsReview).

## Help System

`HelpButton` with `HelpTopic` enum (15 topics). Contextual popovers throughout:
- HomeView: streak
- OnboardingView: skillLevel
- OpeningDetailView: difficulty, learningJourney, paths
- SessionCompleteView: planScore, moveSafety, followingPlan
- PracticeOpeningView: practiceMode
- QuickReviewView: review (toolbar)

## Free Tier Gating

- 3 free openings: Italian, London, Sicilian (configured in AppConfig)
- **Free opening pick**: Post-onboarding, free users choose ONE additional opening to unlock fully
  - Stored in `AppSettings.pickedFreeOpeningID`
  - `FreeOpeningPickerView` shown between onboarding and HomeView for free tier
- HomeView shows lock icons on non-free openings, tapping opens paywall with per-path option
- `SubscriptionService.isOpeningAccessible()` checks: tier + free IDs + picked free + per-path unlocks
- AI features gated by `hasAI` (tier != .free)

## Per-Path Unlock (à la carte)

- `SubscriptionService.purchasePath(openingID:)` — StoreKit non-consumable IAP
- Product IDs follow convention: `com.chesscoach.opening.<openingID>`
- ProUpgradeView shows "Just this opening" card when launched for a specific locked opening
- Users can choose per-path purchase, token unlock, OR tier upgrade from the same paywall

## Token Economy

- `TokenService` (@Observable, @MainActor) — manages balance, purchases, rewards, daily bonus
- `TokenBalance` — balance, totalEarned, totalSpent with credit/debit operations
- `TokenTransaction` — audit trail with reason enum (purchase, dailyBonus, unlockOpening, reward)
- **Earning tokens**: daily login bonus (5/day), layer completion rewards (25 tokens), StoreKit consumable packs
- **Spending tokens**: unlock individual openings (100 tokens each)
- **Token packs**: Small (50), Medium (150), Large (400) — StoreKit consumable IAP
- `TokenStoreView` — purchase packs, claim daily bonus, view balance and transaction history
- Config: `AppConfig.tokenEconomy` (costs, rewards, pack definitions — all tunable)
- Persistence: UserDefaults (balance + last 100 transactions)
- HomeView stats section shows token balance with tap-to-open store
- ProUpgradeView per-path card includes "Use Tokens" button alongside IAP purchase

## Puzzle Mode

- `PuzzleService` generates puzzles from 3 sources:
  1. **Opening Knowledge** — positions from opening book, user finds the book move
  2. **Mistake Review** — positions where user historically makes errors (from MistakeTracker)
  3. **Find the Best Move** — Stockfish-evaluated positions with clear best move (>30cp advantage)
- `Puzzle` model: FEN, solutionUCI/SAN, theme, difficulty (1-5), optional explanation
- `PuzzleModeView`: interactive board, progress bar, streak tracking, hints, feedback, session results
- Free: 5 puzzles/day. Pro: unlimited (gated via `ProFeature.unlimitedPuzzles`)

## Trainer Mode

- Full games against bots with Maia (human-like play) + Stockfish fallback
- 6 bot difficulties: 500-1600 ELO, each with `OpponentPersonality` name/description
- Player chooses color and opponent, plays until checkmate/stalemate/resign
- `TrainerGameResult` persisted (date, outcome, bot ELO, move count)
- `TrainerStats` — wins/losses/draws/win rate across all games

## Move Display Convention

Human-friendly names shown first everywhere ("Knight to f3"), algebraic notation as secondary text.
Canonical converter: `OpeningMove.friendlyName(from:)` — handles captures, promotions, castling.
Applied in: LineStudyView, OpeningPreviewBoard, SessionView feed, deviation banners.

## Overlay Close Buttons

All full-screen overlays have an X close button at top-right:
- SessionCompleteView, PracticeOpeningView completion, ConceptIntroView

## On-Device Model Download

Instead of bundling the ~2.5GB GGUF model in the app binary, `ModelDownloadService` supports downloading it on demand:
- **Downloaded model** stored in Documents directory, preferred over bundled copy
- `OnDeviceLLMService.resolvedModelPath` checks Documents first, then Bundle
- Download progress shown in Settings (AI Coach section) when provider is "On-Device"
- Config: `AppConfig.modelDownload` (remote URL, expected size)
- Gated by `ProFeature.onDeviceModelDownload` (requires onDeviceAI tier or higher)
- User can delete downloaded model to free space (falls back to bundled if available)
